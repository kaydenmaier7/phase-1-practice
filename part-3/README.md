# Part 3: Refactor

## Summary
In Part 3 of the assessment, we'll refactor some provided code.  A number of class have been provided.  Each class is tested for its behaviors.  When these classes were written, knowledge about our application was often times duplicated in multiple places.

## Release 0: Improve Code
Each class in this part of the assessment is fully tested and all the tests pass.  Apply object-oriented principles to improve the quality of the code.

Be sure that all tests continue to pass.  Do not modify the tests.

This part of the assessment is completed when you've refactored the code as best you know how.

## Conclusion
Once you've made all the changes that you find improve the code, you have completed Part 3 of the assessment.  If you haven't done so already, commit your changes and move on to Part 4.
