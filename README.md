# Phase 1 Assessment

## Summary
The Phase 1 Assessment consists of 5 challenges, which each challenge living in
the respective part-<n> directory. The challenges have their own README to provide
instructions. All the commands provided are working under the assumption you are
executing them from the challenge directory (eg. `part-1/`, `part-2/`, etc).

You will have 3.5 hours to work on these challenges. You are permitted to use
on line resources, previous coding challenges, notes, etc, however, you are not
allowed to ask fellow students for assistance.

At the end of the assessment time period, please push up your changes as you have
for challenges throughout the phase, but do not open a pull request.
