# Part 5: Schema Design

## Summary
In this challenge you will need to design the database to persist the data provided by the models in the application.

### Background
The basis of this application is an online store. This has been simplified to try to focus solely on what data is required to fulfill the model's intended concept and show how these models would relate to each other.

## Release 0: Model Attributes
Using [SQL Designer](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql), create the required tables with the corresponding columns that would support the data requirements of each model found in the `part-5/models` directory.

## Release 1: Relationships
Add the supporting foreign keys and/or join tables to allow the required one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

## Conclusion
When you are satisfied with your schema, take a screen shot of SQL Designer and save it as `part-5/schema.jpg`. Create a commit to include the new file and then push your branch. You are now done with part 5.
